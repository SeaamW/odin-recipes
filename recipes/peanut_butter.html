    <h2>What you will need:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The cheapest bread you can find, preferably whole wheat</li>
        <li>Jif peanut butter, crunchy or creamy, your choice</li>
        <li>The ability to eat peanuts</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>if you can't eat peanuts, sorry, try almond or cashew </h5>
    <h5>these will be more expensive though</h5>

    <ol>
        <li>Take sliced bread and place in front of you</li>
        <li>Take out your spoon or knife</li>
        <li>Dip into peanut butter</li>
        <li>Lick peanut butter off spoon or knife</li>
        <li>Wash the spoon or knife unless you live alone and are a little reckless</li>
        <li>Dip back into peanut butter</li>
        <li>Spread the peanut butter on the bread until covered</li>
        <li>Cover both pieces of bread with peanut butter and join them together</li>
    </ol>
    <strong><h5>The most important step:</h5></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Cut the sandwich <strong>horizontally</strong> (yes, I did just say that)
        </li>
    <p>Now, serve with whole milk and proceed to enjoy a classic staple!</p>
